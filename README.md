Simulation of 2d Bouncing Balls in pygame

Just a little project that animates bouncing balls on a screen :)
You can change initial radii, velocities, positions, and masses of two balls.
You can also turn up or down the gravity, drag, and floor bounciness. 
Have fun!

Program imports pygame, sys, math, numpy

Planning to add support for more than two balls and adding more parameters such as different wall/floor bounciness.
